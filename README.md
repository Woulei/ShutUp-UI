# ShutUp - App
> What&#39;s in a name?

## About
This React App uses a [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/Codaisseur/react-starter).
We build it during the Codaisseur Academy. It connects to the [ShutUp API](https://github.com/Woulei/ShutUp-Api). It is a simple chat app that allows users to register and login to start to use the chat function.

__NOTE:__ This was build during the Academy. If I would build it again, I would do it differently. Also the finishing touches were skipped due to the small amount of time available.
__NOTE:__ This was also used as a starter pack for the game needed to build later in the Academy. Check out the [Battleships](https://github.com/Woulei/BattleshipUI) game we build.
